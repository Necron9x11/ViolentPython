Violent Python Chapter 2 Examples Converted from Python v2.7 to Python v3.x
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chapter recreates, in functionality, the 1988 Morris Worm. Written by Robert Morris Jr., the son of Robert Morris - who just happened to be the head of the NSA at the time, the worm infected 6000 systems. in 1988 this constituted roughly 10% of all the computers connected ot the Internet at the time.

I remember this. It was huge news at the time. Not just in the computing world but in the real world as well. It was such a huge deal it made the evneign news. 

At thie time I was studying Unix and C programming at college. The first ISP would not come online for almnost another year, in 1989. Oru only access to the Internet back then was through the University comptuers. 

My roomate did not want to get up and go in to use the lab. He hooked a modem up when no one was looking, so that he could dial in to do his homework. Also the admis had removed commands such as chmod and chow, which hhe wanted to use, so he just wrote programsd to clal the relevabt C functions to so the same thing. As I reclal they were a bit irritated whern they found out about that. Fun times... 

Format
------

In keeping with the format I adopted halfway chapter one the code for this will be broken down into each major section as presented and all of the iterations of the code leading up to the final version will be listed, in the order they were presented, in the comments at the top of the file. 

The final completed program, comprised of oll the sub modules will be listed as morrisWormRedux.py
