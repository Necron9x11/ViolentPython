General Information
-------------------

Initially I was creating one file per chunk of code in the book and the naming convention was to use the page/pages the code appearer on as a component of the file name.

This has proven to be unnecessarily tedious and causes quite a bit of clutter to boot. As such I abandoned this method. 

I had thought to just make each incremental revision of the code a new fork, but the programs are so small, so far at least, that that seems somewhat overboard.

Finally I decided to simply list each increment in comments at the top of the file. The code follows the progression of the book and each revision is noted as to what page(s) it was taken from.
So, as of page 25, the files will each comprise one program example from the book.

Support File Notes

DICTIONARY FILES

Both example files in this chapter rely on a dictionary file and rather than maintain two files there is simply one dictionary file to use with them both: dictionary.txt. 

There is a dictionary2.txt file but that is for the SHA512 mod to the password cracker example. 


ORIGINAL BOOK CODE FILES

The code originally distributed with the book, and available from https://booksite.elsevier.com/9781597499576/?ISBN=9781597499576, is included in the publishedCode subdirectory.
