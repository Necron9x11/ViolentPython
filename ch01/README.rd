Initially I was creating one file per chunk of code in the book and the naming cincention was to use the page/pages the code apopeard on as a component of the fiel name. 

This has proven to be unnecessarilly tedius and causes quite a bit of clutter to boot. 
As such I abandoned this method. Initially I had thought to just make each incremental revision of the code a new fork, but the programs are so small, so far at least, that that seems somewhat overbaord. 

I finally decided to simply list each increment in comments at the top of the file. The code follows the progression of the book and each revision is noted as to what page(s) it was taken from. 

So, as of page 25, the files will each comprise one program example from the book.
